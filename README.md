# Bank Churn Prediction — ML, DL & Quantum ML Notebooks

A collection of Jupyter notebooks implementing end-to-end experiments for predicting bank customer churn using classical machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and exploratory quantum machine learning (QML) approaches. The notebooks walkthrough data loading, preprocessing, feature engineering, model building, evaluation, interpretation and reproducibility notes.

## Project overview
Customer churn prediction is the task of identifying customers who are likely to stop using a bank's services. This repository explores multiple modeling paradigms:
- Classical ML (logistic regression, decision trees, random forest, gradient boosting)
- Deep learning (feed-forward neural networks, regularization, tuning)
- Quantum ML (proof-of-concept quantum circuits / hybrid models using PennyLane / Qiskit)

Each notebook is intended to be runnable and educational: showing data cleaning, feature engineering, training, evaluation (ROC-AUC, precision/recall, confusion matrix), and interpretation (feature importance, SHAP where included).

## Key features
- End-to-end Jupyter notebooks for experimentation and learning
- Baseline classical ML models and model comparison
- DL models with training plots and evaluation metrics
- Exploratory Quantum ML notebook(s) showing hybrid classical-quantum pipelines
- Guidance for reproducibility and environment setup

## Notebooks included
(Adjust the list to match actual filenames in the repository)
- ML_models.ipynb — data preprocessing, baseline models, model comparison
- DL_models.ipynb — neural network experiments, training/evaluation
- QML_experiments.ipynb — introductory quantum experiments and hybrid models
- EDA_and_Feature_Engineering.ipynb — exploratory data analysis and feature prep
- utilities.ipynb or utils/ — helper functions used across notebooks

If your repository uses different filenames, update this README to list the exact notebook names.

## Dataset
This project assumes a tabular dataset containing customer attributes and a churn label. Example datasets:
- "Bank Customer Churn" from Kaggle or other public sources (if used, include exact source and license)
- If a specific CSV is included in the repo (e.g., data/bank_churn.csv), use that directly

Dataset expectations:
- Features: demographic, account activity, product holdings, tenure, balance, etc.
- Target: binary churn flag (0 = retained, 1 = churned)

If you used a specific public dataset, add a link and citation here.

## Installation
Recommended: create an isolated Python environment (venv or conda).

Using python venv:
1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/Sheshaadhri14/Bank-Churn-Prediction-ML-DL-Quantum-ML-.git
2. Create and activate venv:
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # macOS / Linux
   .venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
3. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   (If requirements.txt is not present, install core packages below.)

Core packages (suggested)
- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- jupyterlab or notebook
- notebook widgets (optional)
- tensorflow or torch (for DL experiments)
- shap (optional for interpretation)
- pennylane or qiskit (for QML experiments)

Example:
   pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn jupyterlab tensorflow shap

For QML:
   pip install pennylane pennylane-qiskit qiskit  # or your chosen quantum framework

## Quick start
1. Start Jupyter:
   jupyter lab  # or jupyter notebook
2. Open the notebook(s) you want to run.
3. Make sure the dataset path in the notebook points to your data (or update the path).
4. Run cells sequentially. For long training steps, consider using a subset or increasing compute resources.

## Reproducing results
- Set a random seed at the top of notebooks (numpy, tensorflow/pytorch, scikit-learn) for deterministic runs where applicable.
- Record package versions (pip freeze > requirements_freeze.txt) to help reproduction.
- For DL experiments: training results may differ depending on hardware (CPU vs GPU) and framework versions.
- For QML: simulator vs real hardware will produce different noise characteristics; results shown are best-effort demonstrations.

## Notes on Quantum experiments
- Quantum ML notebooks are proof-of-concept and intended for learning; they are unlikely to outperform classical models on this small tabular task.
- QML implementations may require installing PennyLane, Qiskit or another quantum SDK and a supported simulator or access to cloud quantum backends.
- If you plan to run on real quantum hardware, review provider docs for credentials and execute limits.

## Environment & dependencies
Create a requirements.txt with pinned versions for best reproducibility. Example minimal requirements:
- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- jupyterlab
- tensorflow  # or torch
- shap
- pennylane  # if running QML

Add exact versions for production use:
   pip freeze > requirements.txt

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome. Suggested workflow:
- Fork the repository
- Create a feature branch: git checkout -b feature/your-feature
- Add notebooks or scripts with clear names and documentation
- Open a pull request describing changes and linking to results

Please follow these guidelines:
- Keep notebooks focused and annotated
- If adding large datasets, host them externally (e.g., Kaggle, Google Drive) and include download instructions
- Add requirements for any new dependencies
